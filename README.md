For Assignment 3:

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Ensure the input images are placed in the same directory as the code files. The default input images referenced in the code can be found in the test_data folder. If you wish to use your own images, update the filenames in HDR_Imaging.py accordingly to match your image file names.






Execute the main script (HDR_Imaging.py), which automatically starts the Streamlit application:
python HDR_Imaging.py
The Streamlit application will open in your default browser (or provide a URL in the terminal to access it).













Use the View Debevec Output, View Robertson Output and View Mertens Output buttons to explore the HDR outputs.
